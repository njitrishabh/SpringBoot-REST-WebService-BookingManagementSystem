## Online Web Application to manage the reservations on a campsite. 
## Using Spring-Data-JPA, H2-Database, SpringBoot, Maven


#### To streamline the reservations a few constraints need to be in place -

1. The campsite will be free for all.
2. The campsite can be reserved for max 3 days.
3. The campsite can be reserved minimum 1 day(s) ahead of arrival and up to 1 month in advance. Reservations can be cancelled  anytime.
4. For sake of simplicity assume the check-in & check-out time is 12:00 AM


#### System Requirements

- The users will need to find out when the campsite is available. 
- So the system should expose an API to provide information of the availability of the campsite for a given date range with the default being 1 month.
- Provide an end point for reserving the campsite. The user will provide his/her email & full name at the time of reserving the campsite along with intended arrival date and departure date. 
- Return a unique booking identifier back to the caller if the reservation is successful. 
- The unique booking identifier can be used to modify or cancel the reservation later on. 
- Provide appropriate end point(s) to allow modification/cancellation of an existing reservation
- Due to the popularity of the island, there is a high likelihood of multiple users attempting to reserve the campsite for the same/overlapping date(s). 
- Demonstrate with appropriate test cases that the system can gracefully handle concurrent requests to reserve the campsite. -- Provide appropriate error messages to the caller to indicate the error cases.
- In general, the system should be able to handle large volume of requests for getting the campsite availability.
- There are no restrictions on how reservations are stored as as long as system constraints are not violated.
